                <p>
                    We will be using various data visualization techniques, including scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps, to visualize the data and identify trends and patterns.
                <br>
                We will also be using interactive tools such as D3.js and Plotly to create dynamic visualizations that allow users to filter the data and view specific subsets of the data.

                <h3>The purpose of visualizations</h3>
                <p>
                    The data used for this visualization is likely a subset of a larger dataset that contains information on the salaries of data scientists in different years and in different locations. The purpose of this visualization is to provide insights into the distribution of salaries for data scientists in a particular year and to identify any trends or patterns in the data.
                        </p>
                   <p> Overall, the visualization is a useful tool for exploring and understanding the data and can be used to inform decisions related to compensation and hiring practices for data scientists.
